# docker-compose-laravel
A pretty simplified docker-compose workflow that sets up a LEMP network of containers for local Laravel development. You can view the full article that inspired this repo [here](https://medium.com/@aschmelyun).


## Usage

To get started, make sure you have [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) on your system, and then clone this repository. Add your entire Laravel project to the `src` folder, then open a terminal and from this cloned respository's root run `docker-compose build && docker-compose up -d`. 

Open up your browser of choice to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and you should see your Laravel app running as intended. 

Containers created and their ports are as follows:

- **nginx** - `:8080`
- **mysql** - `:3306`
- **php** - `:9000`
- **phpmyadmin** - `:8081`
