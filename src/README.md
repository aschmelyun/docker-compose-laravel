## This is where your Laravel app goes

To get started, delete this file and then do one of the following:

- Clone your project or copy all of the files directly into this `src` directory.
- Spin up the Docker network by following the instructions on the main [README.md](../README.md), and install a brand new Laravel project by running in your terminal.
- ```cd src/ && rm README.md```
- ```docker-compose run --rm composer create-project laravel/laravel .```
-  
- `~/vhosts/docker-compose-laravel/src(master)$ docker-compose run --rm composer create-project laravel/laravel .`
- Or you can clone your laravel project in GitHub into the `src/` folder
