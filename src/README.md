## This is where your Laravel app goes

To get started, delete this file and then do one of the following:

- `Clone your project` OR `Create a new project` OR  `Copy all of the files` directly into this `src` directory.
- Spin up the Docker network by following the instructions on the main [README.md](../README.md), and install a brand new Laravel project by running in your terminal.
1. In your terminal go to the `docker-compose-laravel/src` folder: `cd docker-compose-laravel/src`
2. Remove the `README.md`: ```cd src/ && rm README.md```
3. Create a project ```docker-compose run --rm composer create-project laravel/laravel .```
4. Example: `~/vhosts/docker-compose-laravel/src(master)$ docker-compose run --rm composer create-project laravel/laravel .`
